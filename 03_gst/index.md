# Goals, Strategies, and Tactics

<div class="tagline" markdown="1">

deciding what to do and how to do it

</div>

## Terminology

-   A [goal](g:goal) is something you want to accomplish
    -   "Make research fairer, more reliable, and more efficient."
-   A [strategy](g:strategy) is a long-term plan to achieve that
    -   "Increase institutional and individual adoption of open science"
-   A [tactic](g:tactic) is a specific action that fits into a larger strategic plan
    -   "Give researchers credit in performance reviews for creating open-access data sets"
-   Over time, people often confuse strategies with goals
    -   Open science isn't the goal: fairness, reliability, and efficiency are
-   Tactics may conflict with or contradict each other
    -   Giving researchers credit for sharing data incentivizes [salami slicing](g:salami-slicing)
        and the proliferation of useless data sets

### Exercise

In order to discourage researchers from salami slicing their papers,
your university has decreed that people can only submit one paper per year
for consideration by the promotion committee.

1.  Idnetify goals, strategies, and tactics in the statement above.
1.  Identify (at least) three ways in which this proposal can go wrong.

## A Simple Conceptual Framework

-   [Borrego & Henderson 2014](b:Borrego2014) looked at how to increase adoption of evidence-based teaching strategies in STEM
    -   Prescribed (top-down) vs. emergent (bottom-up)
    -   Environments and structures (the system) vs. individuals

### Exercise

1.  Which of these quadrants are you most comfortable working in?
1.  How can you implement the tactics described in that quadrant?

## A Little Philosophy

-   [Isaiah Berlin][berlin-isaiah] defined [two concepts of liberty][berlin-liberty]
    -   "Negative liberty" is freedom *from*, i.e., there's no rule that says you can't do something
    -   "Positive liberty" is freeom *to*, i.e., you have the means and ability to pursue a goal
-   Those with power will often cede negative liberty without supporting positive liberty
-   Berlin and others also showed that absolute rights often conflict
    -   E.g., freedom of speech vs. freedom from harassment
-   Easy to say "find a balance", but much harder to agree on what that balance *is*
-   Reform movements often tie themselves in knots over this
    -   Deny the conflict
    -   Try to formulate precise rules in advance
-   Two kinds of knowledge [[Scott 1998](b:Scott1998)]
    -   *Techne*: hard-and-fast rules, often derived from first principles
    -   *Metis*: "can be acquired only by long practice at similar but rarely identical tasks
        [and] requires constant adaptation to changing circumstances."
    -   Scientists and programmers want *techne*; organizational change requires *metis*

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">

### Exercise

1.  Describe the last time you tried to apply *techne* when the situation required *metis*.
1.  What have you learned in your current role that qualifies as *techne*? As *metis*?
