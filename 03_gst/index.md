# Goals, Strategies, and Tactics

## Terminology

-   A [goal](g:goal) is something you want to accomplish
    -   "Make research fairer, more reliable, and more efficient."
-   A [strategy](g:strategy) is a long-term plan to achieve that
    -   "Increase institutional and individual adoption of open science"
-   A [tactic](g:tactic) is a specific action that fits into a larger strategic plan
    -   "Give researchers credit in performance reviews for creating open-access data sets"
-   Over time, people often confuse strategies with goals
    -   Open science isn't the goal: fairness, reliability, and efficiency are
-   Tactics may conflict with or contradict each other
    -   Giving researchers credit for sharing data incentivizes [salami slicing](g:salami-slicing)
        and the proliferation of useless data sets

> **Exercise**
>
> In order to discourage researchers from salami slicing their papers,
> your university has decreed that people can only submit one paper per year
> for consideration by the promotion committee.
>
> 1.  Identify (at least) three ways in which this can go wrong.
> 1.  Suggest countermeasures for each.

## A Simple Conceptual Framework

-   [Borrego2014](b:Borrego2014) looked at how to increase adoption of evidence-based teaching strategies in STEM
    -   Prescribed (top-down) vs. emergent (bottom-up)
    -   Environments and structures (the system) vs. individuals

> 1.  Which of these quadrants are you most comfortable working in?
> 1.  How can you implement the tactics described in that quadrant?
