## Communication

- "Someone just mailed me your tweet about the Slack thread so I filed a GitHub issue about updating the Google Doc that keeps track of our wikis."
- Most projects converge on a single channel
  - Mail or Slack, Google Docs or a wiki
- Pick one for synchronous and one for asynchronous
  - Push things from sync to async
- *Make them searchable*

---

## Communication pitfalls

- Use synchronous to build community, not share information
- Throttle discussion
  - "One message per person per topic per day"
  - Makes room for people who need more time to think
- Don't re-argue points endlessly
  - Archive decisions and point to them
- No disparagement or feigned surprise
  - "Maybe next time you could think before you type?"
  - "Gosh, I thought *everyone* knew Xâ€¦"

## Get the word out

- [Define your audiences](../communications/)
- Blog regularly
  - Papers are supposed to sound objective
  - Blog posts should be excited and opinionated
- Your site generator can handle the mechanics
- Make things findable
  - Tag early, tag often
- Make things accessible
  - Describe your images

---

## Pathways to contribution

- Tag some issues as good first issue
- Go through first review in more detail or by video
- Provide runnable examples in docs
  - And ask newcomers to update them
- Show newcomers how to write good bug reports
  - Reproducible examples (reprexes)

---

## At the end of the day

- Recognize contributions
  - Add names to [`CITATION.cff`](../mechanics/)
- Thank people publicly
  - Especially when they move on
- Designate your own successor
  - Who can also run things temporarily when you're on holiday, ill, or busy
