## What problems are we trying to solve?

- Can't make necessary changes
  - "You'll need a form requisition form for that"
  - "That just not the sort of thing we do"
- Can't get credit for necessary work
  - "Merely useful"
- These rules are drawn in part from <cite>Brown2007,Manns2015</cite>

---

## 1. Be sure

- It's going to take years
- It could well fail
- There are many other things you could do
- So be sure *this* change is the one you want to fight for

---

## 2. *Nihil pro nobis sine nobis*

- "Nothing for us, without us"
- Ask the people most likely to be affected
  - Often reveals potential allies

---

## 3. Be specific

- Few people would argue (in public) against fair hiring practices in principle
- But organizations have to implement something specific
  - And people very well might argue against those specifics
- Pick something specific and achievable and make a concrete plan for achieving it
- Start with whatever is likely to have broadest support
  - Because success breeds success

---

## 4. [Power mapping](g#power-mapping)

- Figure out who actually has the power to make that change and what *they* care about
  - Your neighbors don't make school policy: school board trustees do
- Three people on the right committee can sometimes do more than three thousand protesting in the streets

## If you have time on your hands…

- The open access/data/science movement could and should run slates of candidates for positions in professional societies
- Or send pointed questionnaires to candidates and publish ratings of their responses

---

## 5. Build alliances

- Work with people who want the same change as you
  - Do you want to win or to be in charge?
- Help someone who doesn't oppose your change get what they want in exchange for their support

---

## 5. Build alliances

- Figure out who is going to be hurt by the change you want
- Find some way to help them, divert them, or neutralize them
- The weapons of the weak are very powerful in the hands of disgruntled functionaries <cite>Scott1987</cite>

---

## 6. Test the waters

- Refine your idea and presentation in front of a small group
  - Repeatedly
- Accept that you might initially want the wrong thing
  - That's what listening means…
- Ask someone to be the official skeptic
  - Giving them a way to critique in private may temper their public criticism
  - And you just might convert them

---

## 7. Keep it visible

- Easy to blog and tweet
  - But that ease has diluted those channels' impact
- Be included in someone else's newsletter?
  - Which will make you look more credible
- Make a presentation at some other (recognized) event
- Always share a single point of contact
  - That someone checks frequently

---

## 8. Collect data but tell stories

- Sooner or later someone is going to ask about financial impact, so be ready
  - Data from similar organizations or ventures helps your credibility
- But stories have more impact
- Don't explain what *kind* of people this will help
- Explain how it helped *a specific person*
  - If you've never cried when telling that story, tell a better story

---

## 9. Tempo

- Those who want change can move faster than those who don't
  - Never give the institution time to regroup
- But you can't play jazz well unless you're technically proficient
  - Learn how to [run meetings and make decisions](../governance/)

---

## 10. Take a breath

- Burnout is an occupational hazard
  - We get so used to doing things on our own at the start that we don't share the load when we can
- So celebrate when you can, grieve when you need to

---

So how do you persuade people to do something?

---

## 1. Don't

- If you have to talk someone into something, odds are that they don't really want to do it
- Respect that
  - Better to leave something undone than to engender resentment

---

## 2. Be kind

- Lots of books on sales (and dating) teach psyhological manipulation
  - Only works once
  - You don't want to be that person
- Kindness is usually reciprocated
  - And even if it's not, at least you were kind

---

## 3. Appeal to the greater good

- Don't open with "here's what's in it for you"
  - Signals that they should be seeking personal advantage (possibly at your expense)
- Instead, explain how you and they are going to make the world a better place
- And mean it
  - If what you're proposing *isn't* going to make the world better, propose something else

---

## 4. Start small

- Most people are reluctant to dive into things head-first
- So give them a chance to test the waters and to get to know you
  - [Pathways to contribution](../newcomers/)
- It will often end there
  - Everyone is busy, tired, or has projects of their own

## The [90-9-1 rule](g#90-9-1)

- 90% of people will watch
- 9% will speak up
- 1% will actually do things
- Set your expectations accordingly

---

## 5. Build a community

- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) aren't just about teaching
- They're places where people can hang out with other people who share their hopes and values
- Find one if you can, build one if you have to

---

## 6. Establish a point of connection

- "I was speaking to X" or "we met at Y" gives people context
  - Makes them more comfortable
  - Makes you more credible
- Be specific
  - "I recently came across your website" isn't convincing

---

## 7. Establish your credibility

- Who are your backers?
- How big are you?
- How long have you been around?
- Joining forces with an existing movement helps

---

## 8. Tell people what you want

- They need to figure out whether their skills and available time match your needs
- It's also a sign of respect
  - Telling people you're moving a few boxes when you're packing up an entire house only works once

---

## 9. Create a slight sense of urgency

- "We're going to launch this in the spring" vs. "We'd eventually like to launch this"
- The word "slight" is important
  - If your request is urgent, people will assume you're disorganized or that something has gone wrong
  - And will then err on the side of prudence

---

## 10. Take a hint

- If the first person you ask says "no", ask someone else
- If the fifth or the tenth person says "no", ask yourself:
  - Am I asking the right way?
  - Am I asking for the right things?
  - Is this a reasonable goal?
  - Is this a worthwhile goal?
