Researchers studying everything from sexual health to COVID-19 to gun
violence are increasingly likely to be targeted because of their work.
While research institutions have rules for safeguarding sensitive
information, these don't address the problem of keeping the
researchers themselves safe. The ten tips below do not guarantee
complete safety, any more than seatbelts guarantee safe driving, but
following them greatly reduces the likelihood of harm.

## 1. Put on your own mask

You can't rely on companies, universities, and other institutions to
protect you, for the simple reason that they are not penalized if they
don't: data breaches have minimal impact on companies' profitability
and the people responsible for them are rarely fined, much less
jailed.

Much of what institutions force you to go through is
security theater](g#security-theater) intended to make you
believe something is being done rather
than to actually make you safer.  In fact, security theater often
encourages you to cut corners in ways that make you *less* safe: for
example, forcing you to change passwords every three months encourages
you to choose memorable (and therefore easy-to-guess) passwords. Until
this changes, you have to take responsibility for your own digital
safety.

## 2. Digital security is rarely the weakest link

Most attacks take place offline, and the most effective ones are often
the simplest: it is far easier to trick someone into giving you their
password than to break into their devices digitally.

The key practice is [situational awareness](g#situational-awareness),
which is a fancy way of
saying, "Pay attention to what's happening and respond accordingly."
For example, agreeing to be an expert witness in a trial increases the
odds that you will be targeted. The corollary is to de-escalate when
you can to avoid [security fatigue](g#security-fatigue)
<cite>Stanton2016</cite>:
if you are too tired to follow good practices, knowing them does you
no good.

## 3. Use appropriate threat models

Most of us aren't involved in issues of national security; instead, we
typically face one of three kinds of threat:

- [Casual threats](g#casual-threat) are opportunistic. For example, Monica, a professor in
  psychology, is targeted by Mohan, an undergraduate in computer science who
  spends hours every day in online echo chambers complaining about how "SJW
  bullshit" is ruining tech. He really didn't enjoy Monica's guest lecture on
  discrimination and inclusivity in his software engineering class, and thinks
  it would be a laugh to make her the target of anonymous abuse online. He's
  unlikely to invest significant effort in his attack (at least not initially),
  but his attack may be backed up by more knowledgeable members of online
  forums.

- [Intimate threats](g#intimate-threat) come from people who know their targets' passwords or have
  a chance to install spyware on their targets' devices <cite>Leitao2019</cite>.
  For example, Elena, graduate student, is targeted by her former romantic
  partner Eric, who is also a graduate student but not in the same department.
  Their relationship had become increasingly abusive over the last two years.
  With the help of friends, Elena has moved out of their shared apartment and is
  rebuilding her life; Eric is obsessed with the idea that she left him for
  someone else and is now stalking her.

- [Insider threats](g#insider-threat) come from people who have legitimate access to
  accounts and devices. For example, Boris, professor of medicine, is
  targeted by Bethany, who works for the university's IT department.
  Boris has agreed to serve as an expert witness in an upcoming
  liability case involving a large chemical company; Bethany has been
  asked by a former colleague to find out what he is going to say in
  order to discredit his testimony.

## 4. Use a password manager

Using a weak password is a good way to ensure your account will
eventually be compromised. Using a clever password scheme, such as the
name of the site plus a word only you know, does not increase security
by much: whatever scheme you have thought of, attackers have seen
before. And since people are often identified on multiple sites by the
same email address, as soon as one site where you've used that scheme
is compromised, attackers can guess the scheme and use it elsewhere.

Since strong passwords are hard to remember and to type, use a
[password manager](g#password-manager) that generates strong passwords and saves them all
under a master [passphrase](g#passphrase) that is several words long. It does create
a single point of attack, but is still safer than choosing passwords
yourself, since password managers aren't fooled by similar-seeming
sites like paypaI.com.

## 5. Use two-factor authentication

Authentication relies on something you *know* (like a password),
something you *have* (like a security key), or something you *are*
(like your fingerprints). Two-factor authentication](g#2fa) (2FA) requires
two of these together, e.g., a password (which can be stolen
electronically) plus a random code generated by an app on your phone
(which means attackers need access to you).

*Never* share a 2FA confirmation code: a common attack is to trigger a
password reset and then call the victim pretending to be from the IT
department and ask them to read the code back to "verify" your
account. As soon as you do this, the attacker can change your password
and get into your account.

## 6. Think before opening

Attempts to get you to open an email attachment that contains
malicious code, click on a link, install software, or log into a
website are called [phishing](g#phishing) attacks. The strongest defense is to
never do these things, but that would make most work impossible. The
second-best defense is to invest in virus scanning software.

And don't click links in emails without checking them first: hover
over the link and see if it matches the site it claims to be, or log
into the site manually rather than following the provided link.
When you go to a web site, check the real domain name in the URL:
paypaI.com with an upper-case "I" instead of a lower-case "l" is not
the site it pretends to be, and `wwwpaypal.com` is a different domain
than `www.paypal.com`.

## 7. Erase before discarding

Moving files into the trash and then emptying it does not actually erase the
data: it just tells the computer that the space is available for reuse. (This is
why reporters and private investigators regularly go dumpster diving.) The best
way to address this problem is to encrypt your hard drive, which is a quick
setup option for all major operating systems these days.

Even with that, you should act as if any device you throw away is going to fall
into unfriendly hands. Use a secure deletion tool like [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org/) (Linux or
Windows) or [FileShredder](https://voidtech.net/apps/fileshredder/) (MacOS)
before selling, recycling, or discarding your
hardware, but keep in mind that this doesn't affect backups or files stored
online on sites like Dropbox. And keep in mind that it is practically impossible
to truly delete data from social networking sites: in most cases, their
"delete" usually means "don't show any more" rather than "erase all past
record of".

## 8: Check your devices and accounts periodically

Many tech companies who offer free services make money by selling
targeted advertising using the data they have about you.  But since
GMail and social media are a fact of life for most of us, you should
check your settings periodically, just as you would take your car in
for an oil change. Turn off everything you can and then use a tracking
blocker such as [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) to reduce information leakage.

## 9. Fight back

Casual attackers may eventually get bored and move on, but like all
bullies, they will also often revisit previous victims.  Even if they
don't, they are likely to pick new ones, so if you have been attacked:

- *Find support.* Being targeted is frightening and wearying,
  particularly if you belong to one of the many groups that are
  targeted in real life as well as online. Let family, friends, and
  colleagues know what is happening so that they can support you. They
  may also be able to offer advice if they have been in similar
  situations.

- *Use anti-harassment apps* like [Block Party](https://www.blockpartyapp.com/).
  Save emails, and take screenshots of sites like Facebook and Twitter
  in case attackers delete or alter material.

- *Do not engage directly.* Casual attackers are often seeking
  attention, so a direct response often encourages further attacks
  (and can draw attention from like-minded attackers).

- *Report the attack.* Social media sites have done everything they
  can to avoid legal accountability for online attacks, but they are
  more likely to take action if they believe that you might speak
  publicly about what has happened and thereby damage their
  reputation.  Never agree to a non-disclosure agreement that would
  prevent you from doing so.

## 10. Remember that it's not all about you

We don't just wear masks to prevent ourselves from becoming infected:
we also wear them so that we will not infect others. Similarly, if you
do not take precautions with online security then you are putting
others at risk.  Simple steps like putting passwords on PDFs that
contain sensitive information can go a long way to deter attackers, in
the same way that a sturdy-looking bike lock encourages would-be
thieves to go after some other bike. And if you *are* compromised, let
those affected know as soon as you can.

The only long-term way to improve everyone's online safety is to
pressure politicians to strengthen liability legislation so that
companies, universities, and other institutions have real incentives
to take meaningful action. Cars and drugs are as safe as they are
because their manufacturers are liable for negligence and harm. The
sooner software companies and social media sites are liable as well,
the safer all of us will be.

## A footnote about technology

Two technologies that are useful to a certain extent are Virtual
Private Networks and a specialized web browser called Tor.  A Virtual
Private Network (VPN) connects your device to a server, then has the
server make connections to other machines on your behalf. All messages
between your device and the server are encrypted, and the server can
be managed by professional IT staff in a jurisdiction with tight
privacy laws to increase your safety. [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
routes messages randomly through a network of servers, making traffic
much harder to track. Both reduce risk, but neither eliminates it if
your device is compromised, if the VPN is subpoenaed, or if you log in
to accounts over Tor (thereby revealing your identity to those sites).
