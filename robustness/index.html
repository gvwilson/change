## What problems are we trying to solve?

- Portability
  - "Well, it works on *my* machine… with *my* data…"
- Reproducibility
  - "I'm sure those are the settings we used…"
- Debuggability
  - "Now what?"
- See <cite>Taschuk2017</cite> for background and more detail

---

## Robust software

- Software that works for people other than the original author
- On machines other than its creator's
- That can easily be combined with other tools

---

class: middle center

You *are* using version control, right?

---

class: middle center

And sensible filenames?

---

## Control

- Don't hard-code changeable values
  - People should not have to edit your software to run it
- In particular, do not hard-code paths
  - Common to specify an input *directory* rather than an input *file*
  - Directory must contain specific files with specific names
  - "Convention over configuration"

---

## Control

- Allow commonly-changed parameters to be set on the command line
  - So people can drive your code with shell scripts
- Check parameters at startup
  - So the program doesn't run for two days and *then* announce it doesn't have write permission for the output directory
- Choose reasonable defaults where they exist
  - Set no defaults at all when there aren't reasonable ones
  - Please check "reasonable" with other people

---

## Layered configuration

- Get settings for `splat` from:
  - Per-machine configuration file `/etc/splat.rc`
  - Personal configuration file `~/.splatrc`
  - Project configuration file `./config.rc`
  - Command-line option file `--load-settings <filename>`
  - Individual command-line parameters
- You may also use an [environment variable](g#env-var) (e.g., `SPLAT_SETTINGS`)

---

## Layered configuration

- *Later settings override earlier ones*
- So `--load-settings project.json development.json`
  - Reads settings from `project.json`
  - Overrides them with settings from `development.json`
- No duplicated settings
  - Because sooner or later you'll forget to copy from one file to the other

---

## Show and save configuration

- `splat` should be able to display *all* of its settings
  - `--show-settings` prints to [stdout](g#stdout) and exits
  - `--save-settings <filename>` saves to a file *without* exiting
- Please use [JSON](g#json) or [YAML](g#yaml)
- Include the program's full version number (discussed below)
  - So later versions can handle earlier ones' configurations

---

## (Re-)load configuration

- `--load-settings <filename>` loads the output of `--save-settings`
  - Don't rely on human beings for reproducibility
- So your program should:
  1. Assemble its configuration in a data structure
  2. Then check its sanity

```python
def main():
    config = loadConfiguration()
    checkConfiguration(config)
    run(config)
```

---

## Versioning

- Use [semantic versioning](g#semantic-versioning) `major.minor` or `major.minor.patch`
- Increment `major` when significant features are added or changes break backward compatibility
- Increment `minor` for small enhancements
- Increment `patch` for minor bug fixes

---

## Versioning

- Print the version number when given `--v` or `--version`
- Include the version number in all output
  - Particularly debugging traces
- Libraries should provide a `getVersion()` function
  - For bonus marks, make it recursive
  - I.e., show the versions of libraries you depend on
  - In practice, almost nobody does this

---

## Make old versions available

- Add a [tag](g#version-control-tag) to your repository
- Create a [release](g#release) on GitHub
- Release your software on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) or [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)

---

## Documentation

- Don't write a comprehensive manual until you have users
  - Because you might not get any
  - And you'll be guessing what they don't know
- Display summary of options when given `-h` or `--help`
  - Option parsing tools like [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) do this for free

```bash
$ bin/check.py -h
usage: check.py [-h] [--bib BIB [BIB ...]] [--gloss GLOSS]
                [--content CONTENT [CONTENT ...]]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --bib BIB [BIB ...]   specify bibliography file(s)
  --gloss GLOSS         specify glossary file
  --content CONTENT [CONTENT ...]
                        specify content file(s)
```

---

## Documentation

- Everyone starts by copying and modifying examples
  - So include those with your software
  - [tldr.sh](https://tldr.sh/) is a good example to follow

```bash
$ tldr tar
  tar

  Archiving utility.
  Often combined with a compression method, such as gzip or bzip2.
  More information: https://www.gnu.org/software/tar.

  - [c]reate an archive and write it to a [f]ile:
    tar cf target.tar file1 file2 file3

  - [c]reate a g[z]ipped archive and write it to a [f]ile:
    tar czf target.tar.gz file1 file2 file3

  …
```

## Logging

- Use a [logging](g#logging) library
  - Leave `print` statements in your program
  - But turn them on and off selectively
  - Use [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) for Python
    and [`logger`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/logging/index.html) for R
- Standard logging levels are:
  - `DEBUG`: detailed information for debugging
  - `INFO`: things are working as expected
  - `WARNING`: something went wrong but we're OK
  - `ERROR`: program is failing
  - `CRITICAL`: potential loss of data, security breach, etc.

---

## Logging

```python
import logging

config = loadConfig(sys.argv)
logging.basicConfig(filename="splat.log",
                    encoding="utf-8",
                    level=config.loggingLevel) # e.g., logging.WARNING

logging.debug("This message won't appear")
logging.info("Neither will this")
logging.warning("But this will")
logging.error("And so will this")
```

---

## Logging

- Can also send output to multiple destinations
  - Combine messages from all stages of the pipeline in a single place
- Screen and/or file during debugging
- System log, database, web service, etc. in production
  - You may not use these, but the sys admin will

---

## Packaging

- Packages are the atoms of reproducibility
  - And `conda install` or `install.packages()` is easier than anything
- Use whatever [build manager](g#build-manager) your language expects
  - `pip` or `conda` for Python
  - `devtools` for R
- These dictate how files should be organized
  - Unfortunately, they do it in conflicting ways

---

## When to package

- You don't have to make everything a package right away
  - But the more you program, the more often you will
  - In part because so many other tools (e.g., for testing) now assume package structure
- Avoid depending on tools that *aren't* in packages
  - "Download this file and put it in your path" leads to a world of pain
  - As does "clone these five Git repositories and put them on your path"
- People don't always realize which of their tools aren't generally available
  - Only way to find out is to set up on a new machine

---

## No special privileges

- Installing or running as root is often convenient
  - Bypasses a lot of pesky safety checks
- But those checks are there for good reasons
  - One over-eager file-matching expression can do a lot of harm
  - And more than one supercomputer has been used to mine bitcoin
- Requiring root also makes life harder for sys admins
  - As does requiring a package-specific account

---

## Workflow

- [Workflow managers](g#workflow-manager) run programs:
  - In the right order
  - With the right options
  - If necessary
  - To process specific data
  - On the available machines
- Share many features with [build managers](g#build-manager)
- Hundreds have been written, [dozens](https://github.com/meirwah/awesome-workflow-engines) are in active use
  - [`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) for R
  - [`snakemake`](https://snakemake.github.io/) for Python
  - [Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/) widely used in bioinformatics

---

## Dry runs

- `make --dry-run` prints the commands it *would* run, but doesn't run them
- If your workflow tool doesn't support this:
  1. Give each stage a `--dry-run <filename>` option
  2. If that flag is present, the tool checks its configuration and outputs that file immediately

---

## Project templates

- All of this is a lot to set up
- Tools like [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) create projects from templates
- But knowing when it's worth making things robust comes with experience
- If there are tools or practices we haven't discussed, please [let us know](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com)
