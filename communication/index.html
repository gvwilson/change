## What problems are we trying to solve?

- Awareness
  - "I didn't know your project existed"
  - (unspoken) "And now that I do, I don't know why I should care"
- Usability
  - "Read the source" is the middle finger of open source
- Documentation is out of step with code
  - "Lies, damn lies, and FAQs"

---

## Your actual product

- Your actual product is your grant proposals <cite>Kuchner2011</cite>
  - That's what people give you money for
- Your papers are "just" proof that you're worth funding
  - Because funders have a signal-to-noise problem too

## Marketing

> Making sure that the people who ought to know
> how you can make their lives better
> actually do know.

- If what you offer isn't actually useful, this relies on psychological tricks
  - Manufacturing desire
- If what you offer *is* useful, the challenges are:
  1. Thinking like someone else
  2. Being heard above the noise

---

## You are not your users

- Person writing a paper:
  - Are the error bars right?
  - Do my co-authors agree with the conclusions?
  - Will this be accepted before someone else gets the same result?
- Person reading a paper:
  - Did the authors cite my work?
  - Does this paper support my current research direction?
  - Can I use their data or software to speed up my work?

---

## Figure out who you're trying to help

- Our [home page](../) has this workshop's [learner persona](g#persona)
- Who is the customer for your proposals?

> Dalha, 58, is a professor in geophysics and the Dean of Science at [university].
> She is evaluated annually on (a) how many high-citation publications faculty produce,
> (b) whether research funding is increasing year-on-year, and
> (c) how many of the university's PhD graduates are offered tenure-stream positions at top-10 schools.
> Dalha is passionate about getting more young women into STEM,
> and worried by the number of faculty and grad students
> who are leaving the university for industry.

## Crafting your message

1. For <em><u>description of target audience</u></em>
1. who want <em><u>statement of their needs</u></em>,
1. <em><u>project name</u></em>
1. provides <em><u>statement of key benefits</u></em>.
1. Unlike <em><u>alternative solution</u></em>,
1. we <em><u>key differentiator</u></em>.

---

## Crafting your message

1. For <em>post-docs, junior faculty, and industry equivalents</em>
1. who want <em>to manage research software projects</em>,
1. <em>this workshop</em>
1. provides <em>an introduction to key non-technical skills</em>.
1. Unlike <em>orientation sessions for new faculty and project management courses in industry</em>,
1. we <em>focus on topics particularly relevant to open science</em>.

---

## Getting the message to peers

- Create a project-specific blog and Twitter account
  - But don't expect much traffic
  - Real purpose is the appearance of depth
- Contributing to established channels has more impact
  - Guest post on one of the blogs you read
  - Talk at established conference
  - [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) discussion session,
    guest lecture in someone else's course,
    etc.

---

## Getting the message to funders

- Be part of something larger
  - Borrow legitimacy
  - Note: if you're a senior figure, please lend legitimacy when you can
- [Collect data but tell stories](../change/)
- Contribute to discussion papers, requests for comment, etc.

---

class: sidebar

- All of this takes time away from programming and research
- As project lead, you have to recalibrate your productivity sensors

---

## Branding

- A brand is the first thing people think of when they think of something
- A recognizable logo
- A short, simple tag line

> 1. Be first.
> 2. If you can't be first, create a new category to be first in.

---

## Documentation

- "Marketing before, documentation after"
- You should spend 20% of your time documenting what you build in the other 80%
  - Research publications do *not* count toward this 20%

---

## Define your audience

- A [novice](g#novice) doesn't yet have a mental model of the domain
  - Doesn't know what they don't know
- Needs a tutorial that introduces and illustrates key ideas
  - Leave out the details and special cases for now
  - Use authentic tasks

---

## Define your audience

- A [competent practitioner](g#competent-practitioner) can do routine tasks with routine effort
  - This is as far as most people need to go in most fields
- Will find novice tutorials frustrating
  - "I already know that"
- Needs reference guides, cookbooks, and Q&A sites
  - Can recognize what they need when they see it

---

## Define your audience

- An [expert](g#expert) can solve routine problems at a glance and get the right answer for one-in-a-thousand cases
  - Pattern matching rather than reasoning
- Need the same material as competent practitioners
  - Nobody's memory is perfect
- May also be interested in essays explaining why the code is built the way it is

---

## [False beginners](g#false-beginner)

- Someone who appears to know every little but can transfer understanding from another domain
  - E.g., has never used Python but has done a lot of R or vice versa
  - Knows how to program, just not in this language
- Will find tutorials for true beginners frustratingly slow…
- …but will struggle with reference guides because they don't (yet) have the new vocabulary
- Ideal solution is "X for Y" guide
  - But we usually don't have enough time

---

## README

1. Explain what the software does
2. List required dependencies
   - In a format that can be consumed by a package manager
3. Provide compilation or installation instructions
4. List all input and output files
5. List a few example commands to get a user started quickly
6. State attributions and licensing

---

## Embedded documentation

- Put specially-formatted comments or strings in source files
  - The closer docs are to code, the less likely they are to fall out of step
- Have the [build tool](../mechanics/) extract and format them
  - Automatically create cross-references and an index

---

## However…

- Many technical writers have a dim view of embedded documentation
  - "Never actually up to date"
  - "All the bricks but none of the buildings"
- Prefer separate files with long-form explanations
  - Use a [static site generator](g#ssg)
- Re-run examples embedded in docs automatically to check consistency
  - Computational notebooks

---

## Getting started

- When doing exploratory programming, write a brief note to remind yourself of each file or function's purpose
  - Can tell these are useful if we can read them aloud in the order the functions are called in place of the function's name and parameters
- Begin with an active verb
  - `Extracts`, `normalizes`, `plots`, etc.
  - E.g., `Find current age in years from birth date.`
  - Or, `Clip signals to lie in [0...1].`
- Describe how inputs are turned into outputs and/or what side effects the function has
  - If the function does both, consider rewriting it

---

## In production

1. The name and purpose of every public class, function, and constant
2. The name, purpose, and default value (if any) of every parameter
3. Any side effects the function has
4. The type of value returned by every function
5. What exceptions those functions can raise and when

---

## Example using Sphinx

```python
def calculate_age(birthday):
    """Find current age from birth date.
    
    :param birthday str: birth date
    :returns: age in years
    :rtype: int
    :raises ValueError: if birthday not in YYYY-MM-DD format
    """
```

---

## Creating a useful FAQ

- Hard for creators to guess what questions newcomers will actually have
  - [Expert blind spot](g#expert-blind-spot)
- Harvest questions from discussion forums and online searches
  - Allow people to [tag](../findability/) issues as "question"
  - Turn each one into an FAQ entry or respond with a link to an existing entry
- Establish a tag on Stack Overflow
  - Check regularly and make sure answers are the ones you want

---

## Asking a good question

- Write the most specific title you can
  - "Why does division sometimes give a different result in Python 2.7 and Python 3.5?" is much better than, "Help! Math in Python!!"
- Give context before giving sample code
  - A few sentences to explain what we are trying to do and why helps people determine if their question is a close match or not
- Provide a minimal reproducible example ([reprex](g#reprex))
  - Greatly increases the chances of a useful answer

---

## Asking a good question

- Tag everything
- Use "I" and question words (how/what/when/where/why)
  - Forces you to think more clearly about what you're asking
- Keep each item short
  - May feel like trivializing
  - But is easier to keep up to date
- Provide multiple explanations at different levels
  - Brevity of [tldr.sh](https://tldr.sh/) followed by lengthier explanation for newcomers

1. "Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open standards, and services
   for interactive computing
   across dozens of programming languages."
