<h1>Finishing</h1>
<p class="subtitle">closing the deal and what happens afterward</p>
<h2>Making It Real</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's possible for everyone to agree that your idea is great and implement it right away<ul>
<li>It's also possible to win the lottery three times in a row</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support other causes in exchange for support for yours<ul>
<li>As long as goals don't conflict</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make your idea part of something larger that has broader support<ul>
<li>But avoid making extra work for people during a crunch</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bring in noteworthy outsiders who support your plan<ul>
<li>Even (or especially) if the official purpose of their visit is something else</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If all else fails, settle for a trial run</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Don't</em> whisper in the director's ear.
It might work in the short run,
but people will resent it,
and will either sabotage your implementation,
be less likely to support you in future,
or start using the tactic themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>In groups, discuss a change that ran out of steam before it was implemented.
    What went wrong?
    Was it ever officially halted?</li>
<li>In groups, discuss a change that was implemented successfully.
    What tactics did its proponents use to close the deal that aren't listed above?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h2>Changing Minds</h2>
<ul>
<li>Debate usually doesn't change minds [<a href="../bibliography/#SteinLubrano2025">SteinLubrano2025</a>]<ul>
<li>Most people choose most of their beliefs based on group identity</li>
<li>Believe things (or ignore contradictions) to reduce <a href="../glossary/#cognitive-dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead, take advantage of friendships and other trusting relationships<ul>
<li><a href="../glossary/#social-contact-theory">Social contact theory</a>:
    positive social interactions between members of different groups reduces prejudice,
    particularly in the presence of equal status and shared goals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And use action to shape belief<ul>
<li><a href="../glossary/#situated-cognition-theory">Situated cognition theory</a>:
    people who show up for fundraisers or protests are more likely to adopt those groups' beliefs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Don't</em> rely on social media<ul>
<li>Low activation cost means low commitment [<a href="../bibliography/#Tufekci2018">Tufekci2018</a>]</li>
<li>Creates bubbles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<section class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>Describe an online group you have been part of that <em>didn't</em> accomplish its goals.</li>
<li>Describe something important that you have changed your mind about in the last ten years
    (i.e., fill in the sentence, "I used to think… and now I think…").</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h2>Dealing with Resistance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Formalize the role of skeptic<ul>
<li>Often improves your ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Isolate those who are never going to agree<ul>
<li>Can be to their benefit as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Follow through</em><ul>
<li>Maintenance requires much more effort than construction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<section class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>

    What were its benefits and drawbacks?</li>
</ol>
