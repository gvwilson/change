<h1>Change</h1>
<div class="tagline">
<p>getting started</p>
</div>
<h2>A Framework</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Diffusion of innovations</em> model <a href="../bibliography.html#Rogers2003">Rogers 2003</a></li>
<li>Steps are:<ol>
<li>Knowledge: person becomes aware of a potential change</li>
<li>Persuasion: they form a positive or negative attitude</li>
<li>Decision: they choose to implement, ignore, or oppose</li>
<li>Implementation: they follow through</li>
<li>Confirmation: the change is normalized or abandoned</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Key points:<ul>
<li>People can and will drop out at any stage</li>
<li>Facts aren't enough to persuade: people want numbers, but believe stories</li>
<li>Most people neither support nor oppose most innovations</li>
<li>Most changes eventually languish even if they aren't officially abandoned</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Analyze one recent attempt to change your organization in terms of the five steps described above.</p>
<ol>
<li>What did the advocates of the change do for each step?</li>
<li>Which steps succeeded? Which did not? Why?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Who to Convince First</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <em>Connector</em> is someone who knows everyone<ul>
<li>Help you spread the word</li>
<li>Will expect you to listen to others in turn (exchange of social capital)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <em>Guru</em> is someone whose expertise in some domain is widely respected<ul>
<li>"If Toby likes it, it must be good"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An <em>Innovator</em> is someone who is constantly trying new things<ul>
<li>Least persuasive of the three because they are known to abandon most of the things they try</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: do <em>not</em> attempt to convince <em>Decision Makers</em> first<ul>
<li>"We think" is more persuasive than "I think"</li>
<li>And "we" usually have better ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>Individually, make a short list of people you think are connectors, gurus, and/or innovators in your organization.
    (Include yourself if appropriate.)</li>
<li>In a group, compare your list with those of your colleagues.<ul>
<li>Which potential allies did several of you identify?</li>
<li>Why <em>didn't</em> they include all of yours?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>What to Do First</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start with something <em>small</em><ul>
<li>Less intimidating</li>
<li>Gives you a chance to build skills and community</li>
<li>Less damaging to your reputation if you abandon or retract</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pick something that is <em>already widely supported</em><ul>
<li>Improves odds of success</li>
<li>Makes you appear mainstream rather than radical</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pick something that is <em>immediately useful</em><ul>
<li>Remember, most innovations languish</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>Individually, make a list of three organizational changes that would satisfy these criteria.</li>
<li>In a group, compare your list with those of of your colleagues.<ul>
<li>What potential changes did several of you identify?</li>
<li>Why <em>didn't</em> they include all of yours?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
