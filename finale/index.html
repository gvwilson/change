## A Few Gray Hairs

- Jess is now 40
- Frustrated that their work isn't recognized or rewarded
  - Simulator has almost a thousand users worldwide, many in agriculture and local government
  - But their promotion still depends on research paper publications

## Stay the Course

- Option 1: continue to suffer

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../img/this-is-fine.jpg" alt="This is Fine" width="60%"/>
  </p>
</div>

- Surprising how many RSEs choose this

---

## Option 2: Commercialization

- Initial business model is a mix of:
  - Charging for intensive tutorials and follow-up consulting
  - Adding features
  - Using the software on others' behalf
- Jess must either become an entrepreneur or find a business partner
  - Knows enough to avoid tech transfer offices at universities and government labs
  - Non-research developers encountered through open source are a better source of advice and contacts

## Do Good *and* Get Paid

- Commercialization is not selling out (despite mutters from some senior colleagues)
- Given the uncertainties of government funding, it is the best way to ensure the long-term survival of the simulator
- And it frees up funding for projects that can't get industry support

---

## Option 3: Change the Game

- Help build a community that can push for organizational change
  - Get involved in grant review
  - Spend the social capital they've earned to run for a position in their professional body
- Yes, it means more committees and less time doing research...
  - ...but the alternative is the next generation of researchers having fewer options and opportunities

## Option 3: Change the Game

- And yes, it's like rolling a very large rock up a very steep hill
- But the social structures of research have changed many times in the last century
- They're going to keep changing
- Jess can help them change for the better

## Two Modest Requests

- Please decline to take part in conferences that don't support fully-remote participation
  <cite>Skiles2021</cite>.
- Please ask leadership candidates in your professional society:
  1. What steps will you take in your first year in office
     to ensure that less affluent researchers have an equal opportunity to publish their work?
  1. What specific changes will you make to grant and promotion review procedures
     to ensure that computational work is properly rewarded?
  1. What specific curriculum guideline changes will you recommend
     to ensure that the next generation of researchers are properly prepared
     to engage in computational work?
