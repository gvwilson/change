# Introduction

<p class="subtitle" markdown="1">what this training does and doesn't cover</p>

-   "Most people would rather fail than change." - Robert Wilson
-   But change *does* happen, follows patterns, and can be guided
-   This workshop introduces a few basic ideas and tools
-   Assumes discussion and action are safe in your environment
-   Exercises can be done individually but many work better in small groups (3-4 people)
    -   We will do some exercises asynchronously if we run short of time

> Sessions are not recorded,
> and we request that you do not share notes or exercise results
> with people who did not take part
> without the prior, explicit permission of all attendees.

## Not Covered

-   Community building
    -   Lots of good guides, including [[Alinsky1989](b:Alinsky1989), [Brown2007](b:Brown2007), [Lakey2018](b:Lakey2018)]
    -   Important to distinguish [community of practice](g:community-practice)
        from [community of purpose](g:community-purpose)
-   Communication skills
    -   Change won't happen unless someone can write and speak convincingly
    -   See [[Kuchner2011](b:Kuchner2011)] for some useful insights
-   Electoral politics
    -   If we were serious about open science,
        we would train cohorts of candidates to run for the boards of our professional societies
    -   And school boards and city councils andâ€¦
