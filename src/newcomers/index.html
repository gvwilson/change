## The Problem of Growth

- Both of Jess's projects are now attracting new contributors
  - But nobody ever files an issue or a pull request
  - And most people don't stick around
- Part of the problem seems to be getting started
  - "By the time I was set up, I was out of time"
- Most of this material taken from <cite>Sholler2019</cite>

## What *Is* a "Community"?

A community of practice <cite>Wenger1999</cite>:

1. Participants work on or toward a common product or purpose
2. They are mutually engaged
3. They develop shared resources and domain knowledge

---

## Be Welcoming

- Not enough to say "anyone can contribute"
- Be proactive about fostering positive impression <cite>Steinmacher2015</cite>
  - Welcome messages on social media
  - Dedicated `newcomers` channel on Slack
  - Tag issues as `suitable for beginners`
  - Designated person to contact
- Have a [Code of Conduct](../governance/)
  - Its mere existence sends a strong signal about the kind of community you are
  - Have and publish an enforcement mechanism <cite>Aurora2019</cite>

## Mentoring

- Mentoring programs have mixed results
  - Work well for some people
  - Seem to turn others off
- Provide as an option but don't force it on people

---

## Help People Evaluate Fit

- Saves time on both sides
- List different types of contributions and skills required
  - E.g., "Updating user's guide: needs RMarkdown"
- Note: "basic Julia skills" doesn't help
  - Your idea of "basic" can be quite different from mine

---

## Make Governance Explicit

- Do-ocracy concentrates power in the hands of those with:
  - Good connections
  - Lots of free time
  - Lots of self-confidence
- We'll [come back to this…](../governance/index.html)

---

## Document on Demand

- Out-of-date documentation leads to wasted time
  - More demotivating than not having docs at all
- Guessing at what people will need is usually not productive
- So turn every question into:
  - A vignette
  - An FAQ entry
  - Source code documentation
- Archive things in a findable way
  - Mailing lists are still better than Slack for this
- Search should scan all sources at the same time
- See <cite>Lin2020</cite> for advice

## Develop Pathways to Participation

Legitimate peripheral participation:

> Newcomers become members of a community by participating in simple,
> low-risk tasks that further the goals of the community.
> Through these peripheral activities,
> newcomers become acquainted with the community's tasks, vocabulary, and governance
> so that they can ease into the project.

---

## Develop Pathways to Participation

- Submit a bug report (versus fixing a bug)
- Help with translation and localization
- Test-drive a new tutorial
- Particularly important for people who have been excluded in the past <cite>Ford2016</cite>

---

## Make It Easy to Get Started

- Create a `CONTRIBUTING` file
  - And test it regularly
- Its existence reassures newcomers that you care about them
- Helps experienced project members too
  - "Wait, that's changed?"

---

## Use In-Person Interaction Carefully

- Newcomers benefit from events that offer:
  - structured pedagogy *and*
  - less structured periods devoted to hacks and creative projects <cite>Huppenkothen2018</cite>
- Best when combined with larger events to amortize travel costs

---

## Use In-Person Interaction Carefully

- Remember that many people:
  - Are introverted
  - Have family responsibilities
  - Find travel physically challenging
  - Can't afford it
  - Can't get visas
- Don't make them feel left out
  - Have note-takers for as many activities as possible
  - Have online discussions afterward

---

## Acknowledge All Contributions

- Gratitude and recognition are powerful incentives
  - "A programmer will do something for a laptop sticker that they would not do for a hundred dollars"
  - (If they can afford to, that is)
- Adopt and publicize guidelines about who is acknowledged where and for what
- Do not ignore "invisible" contributions
  - Code reviews don't show up in Git logs
  - We're still trying to figure this out…

---

## Follow Up

- Check in with people immediately after their first contribution
  - Congratulate them
  - Help them find the next thing to work on
- Also check in with people who started but didn't finish
  - "What could we have done better?"
  - May also want to have an external person handle this

## Fresh Eyes

1. Swap contribution guidelines with another workshop participant.
   What *can't* you find out in the first 5 minutes?

1. Who gets credit for what kind of work in your project?
   Who does other kinds of work but isn't credited?
   Is this written down?
