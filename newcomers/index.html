## What problems are we trying to solve?

- Attracting new members
  - "Nobody ever files an issue or a pull request"
- Keeping them
  - "A lot of new faces, not a lot of familiar ones"
- Helping them be productive
  - "By the time I was set up, I was out of time"
- Most of this material taken from <cite>Sholler2019</cite>

## What is "community"?

A [community of practice](g#community-of-practice) <cite>Wenger1999</cite>

1. Participants have a common product or purpose they work on or toward
2. They are mutually engaged
3. They develop shared resources and domain knowledge

---

## 1. Be welcoming

- Not enough to say "anyone can contribute"
- Be proactive about fostering positive impression <cite>Steinmacher2013</cite>
  - Welcome messages on social media
  - Dedicated `newcomers` channel on Slack
  - Tag issues as `suitable for beginners`
  - Designated person to contact

---

## 1. Be welcoming

- Have a [Code of Conduct](../governance/)
  - Its mere existence sends a strong signal about the kind of community you are
- Have and publish an enforcement mechanism <cite>Aurora2019</cite>

## Mentoring

- Mentoring programs have mixed results
  - Work well for some people
  - Seem to turn others off
- Provide as an option but don't force it on people

---

## 2. Help potential contributors evaluate fit

- Saves time on both sides
- List different types of contributions and skills required
  - E.g., "Updating user's guide: needs RMarkdown"
- Note: "basic Julia skills" doesn't help
  - Your idea of "basic" can be quite different from mine

---

## 3. Make governance explicit

- Because [meritocracy](g#meritocracy) concentrates power in the hands of those with:
  - Good connections
  - Lots of free time
  - Lots of self-confidence
- Large projects become companies or non-profits
  - Legally required to have bylaws
- Use [Martha's Rules](../governance/) as soon as you have contributors who don't work for you

---

## 4. Keep knowledge up to date and findable

- Out-of-date documentation leads to wasted time
  - More demotivating than not having docs at all
- Tempting to put information in the "right" format
- But most project conversation converges on:
  - One channel for real-time (e.g., Slack)
  - One location for archival (e.g., GitHub issues or [Markdown](g#markdown) pages in a Git repo)
- [Search](../findability/) should scan both at the same time

---

## 5. Develop pathways to participation

[Legitimate peripheral participation](g#lpp)

> Newcomers become members of a community by participating in simple,
> low-risk tasks that further the goals of the community. Through these
> peripheral activities, newcomers become acquainted with the community's
> tasks, vocabulary, and governance so that they can ease into the
> project.

---

## 5. Develop pathways to participation

- Submit a bug report (versus fixing a bug)
- Help with translation and localization
- Test-drive a new tutorial
- Particularly important for people who have been excluded in the past <cite>Ford2016</cite>

---

## 6. Make it easy for newcomers to get started

- Always have [a `CONTRIBUTING` file](../mechanics/)
  - And test it regularly
- Its existence reassures newcomers that you care about them
- Helps experienced project members too
  - "Wait, that's changed?"

---

## 7. Use in-person interaction carefully

- Newcomers benefit from events that offer:
  - structured pedagogy *and*
  - less structured periods devoted to hacks and creative projects <cite>Huppenkothen2018</cite>
- Best when combined with larger events to amortize travel costs

---

## 78. Use in-person interaction carefully

- But many people:
  - Are introverted
  - Have social anxiety
  - Can't afford travel
  - Can't get visas
- Don't want them to feel left out
  - Have note-takers for as many activities as possible
  - Have online discussions afterward

---

## 8. Acknowledge all contributions

- Gratitude and recognition are powerful incentives
  - "A programmer will do something for a laptop sticker that they would not do for a hundred dollars"
  - (If they can afford to, that is)
- Adopt and publicize guidelines about who is acknowledged where and for what
- Do not ignore "invisible" contributions
  - Code reviews don't show up in Git logs
  - We're still trying to figure this outâ€¦

---

## 9. Follow up on both success and failure

- Check in with people immediately after their first contribution
  - Congratulate them
  - Help them find the next thing to work on
- Also check in with people who started but didn't finish
  - "What could we have done better?"
  - May also want to have an external person handle this

class: exercise

## How easy is it to get started?

1. Swap contribution guidelines with another workshop participant.
1. What *can't* you find out in the first 5 minutes?

---

class: exercise

## Who is acknowledged for what?

1. Who gets credit for what kind of work in your project?
1. Who does other kinds of work but isn't credited?
1. Is this written down?
