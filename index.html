	<h2>About the Workshop</h2>
        <p>
          This workshop introduces the ideas and tools you need
          to manage a team of up to a dozen people working together to build research software.
          Topics range from how to make new contributors feel welcome
          to workflow, licensing, and software design,
          and every lesson includes hands-on exercises.
        </p>
        <p>

	<h2>Learner Persona</h2>
	<p>
	  Jo, 31, completed a PhD in geology several years ago and now works for a national laboratory.
	  The fracture modeling software they wrote in grad school
	  is now being used by two dozen research groups around the world,
	  several of which have started contributing fixes and extensions of varying quality.
	  Jo has just been given a post-doc and a junior programmer to expand the code as well,
	  and wants to learn how to decide which pull requests are safe to merge,
	  decide what's most important to work on next,
	  and handle people who spend more time arguing on Slack than they do writing code.
	  This workshop will show them what a healthy mid-sized project looks like
	  and how to manage both staff and external contributors.
