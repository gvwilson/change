	      <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
              <p>
		This workshop introduces the ideas and tools you need
		to manage a team of up to a dozen people working together to build research software.
		Topics range from what a minimum viable project looks like technically
		through bringing new people on board
		to getting the word out about your work,
		deciding what to build next,
		and keeping everyone on track.
              </p>
	      <p>
		The workshop consists of four hour-long sessions delivered online on consecutive days or weekly.
		Participants are expected to spend half an hour to an hour on exercises after each session.

	      <p>
		Jess, 31, completed a PhD in ecology three years ago and now works for a national lab.
		The data cleanup and simulation software they wrote in grad school
		is being used by two dozen research groups around the world,
		several of which have started contributing fixes and extensions of varying quality.
		Jess has just been given a post-doc and a junior programmer,
		and needs to decide which pull requests are safe to merge,
		what everyone should work on next,
		and how to handle people who spend more time arguing on Slack than writing code.
		This workshop will show them what a healthy mid-sized project looks like
		and how to manage both staff and external contributors.
