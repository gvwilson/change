## Learner Persona

-   Sabina, 28, has a master's degree in animal physiology
    and now works as a data analyst for a mid-sized pharmaceutical company.
-   Sabina takes open access publishing and open source software for granted,
    but has never been involved in politics or advocacy beyond signing a few online petitions.
-   Sabina's company doesn't have a policy on staff contributing to open source projects,
    and the head of her department occasionally grumbles about "all this diversity stuff" distracting people from "real work".
    Sabina wants unambiguous permission for the former and official company support for the latter.
-   Sabina doesn't enjoy public speaking,
    and finds face-to-face conflict very stressful.
