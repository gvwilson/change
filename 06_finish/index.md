# Finishing

<p class="subtitle" markdown="1">closing the deal and what happens afterward</p>

## Making It Real

-   It's possible for everyone to agree that your idea is great and implement it right away
    -   It's also possible to win the lottery three times in a row
-   Support other causes in exchange for support for yours
    -   As long as goals don't conflict
-   Make your idea part of something larger that has broader support
    -   But avoid making extra work for people during a crunch
-   Bring in noteworthy outsiders who support your plan
    -   Even (or especially) if the official purpose of their visit is something else
-   If all else fails, settle for a trial run

## Changing Minds

-   Debate usually doesn't change minds [[SteinLubrano2025](b:SteinLubrano2025)]
    -   Most people choose most of their beliefs based on group identity
    -   Believe things (or ignore contradictions) to reduce [cognitive dissonance](g:cognitive-dissonance)
-   Instead, take advantage of friendships and other trusting relationships
    -   [Social contact theory](g:social-contact-theory):
        positive social interactions between members of different groups reduces prejudice,
        particularly in the presence of equal status and shared goals
-   And use action to shape belief
    -   [Situated cognition theory](g:situated-cognition-theory):
        people who show up for fundraisers or protests are more likely to adopt those groups' beliefs
-   *Don't* rely on social media
    -   Low activation cost means low commitment [[Tufekci2018](b:Tufekci2018)]
    -   Creates bubbles

## Dealing with Resistance

-   Formalize the role of skeptic
    -   Often improves your ideas
-   Isolate those who are never going to agree
    -   Can be to their benefit as well
-   *Follow through*
    -   Maintenance requires much more effort than construction
