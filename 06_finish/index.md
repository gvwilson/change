# Finishing

<p class="tagline" markdown="1">closing the deal and what happens afterward</p>

## Making It Real

-   It's possible for everyone to agree that your idea is great and implement it right away
    -   It's also possible to win the lottery three times in a row
-   Support other causes in exchange for support for yours
    -   As long as goals don't conflict
-   Make your idea part of something larger that has broader support
    -   But avoid making extra work for people during a crunch
-   Bring in noteworthy outsiders who support your plan
    -   Even (or especially) if the official purpose of their visit is something else
-   If all else fails, settle for a trial run

## Dealing with Resistance

-   "Most people would rather fail than change." - Robert Wilson
-   Formalize the role of skeptic
    -   Often improves your ideas
-   Isolate those who are never going to agree
    -   Can be to their benefit as well
-   *Follow through*
    -   Maintenance requires much more effort than construction
