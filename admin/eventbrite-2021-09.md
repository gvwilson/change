How to manage people and code as your research software project grows.

This workshop introduces the ideas and tools you need to manage a team of up to a dozen people working together to build research software. Topics include:

- how to run an effective meeting,
- how to recruit new contributors and help them be productive,
- how your responsibilities change when you go from coding to managing,
- how to design complex software and ensure its reliability,
- and more.

The workshop will  run online from 10:00-14:00 Toronto time on Sept 29 and Sept 30, and will include many hands-on exercises. All proceeds will go to support MetaDocencia, an inclusive and collaborative community that improves education by empowering instructors from underserved countries.

Dr. Greg Wilson co-founded and was the first executive director of Software Carpentry and is the author, co-author, or co-editor of several books, including Research Software Engineering with Python, Teaching Tech Together, and The Architecture of Open Source Applications. Greg is a member of the Python Software Foundation and a recipient of ACM SIGSOFT's Influential Educator of the Year award.
