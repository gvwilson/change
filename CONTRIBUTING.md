-   Install dependencies: `uv sync`.
-   Run `make` on its own to see a list of common commands.

## Structure

-   Lessons are in `slug` directories
    -   `slug` is short mnemonic
    -   Each lesson must have an `index.md` file containing its content
    -   And may also have a `slides.md` file with [Shower][shower] slides
-   Use `@/some/path/` for internal links
    -   The leading `@` is translated into a relative reference to the project root
-   The Markdown link definitions in `extras/links.md` are appended to all Markdown files
    -   This helps ensure consistent link URLs across pages
-   The home page for the site is generated from `README.md`
    -   The navigation menus for lessons and appendices are generated from
        the `lessons` and `appendices` `div` elements in `README.md`
-   Diagrams should be SVG files created with [draw.io][draw-io]
-   `bibliography/index.md` has the bibliography as a definition list
    -   Citation keys have IDs for linking
    -   Use an inline HTML link `b:key` in files to create links
-   `glossary/index.md` has the glossary as definition list
    -   Reference keys have IDs for linking
    -   Use an inline HTML link `g:key` in files to create links
-   The `static` directory contains CSS and JavaScript files
-   The `templates` directory contains [Jinja][jinja] templates used to generate HTML
    -   `page.html` is used for website pages
    -   `slides.html` is used for slideshows
