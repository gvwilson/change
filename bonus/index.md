## Change in a Time of Crisis

-   Crisis creates urgency
    -   People are more willing to accept rapid changes during a crisis because the status quo is clearly failing
-   Crisis forces prioritization
    -   Limited resources force people to focus what's truly essential
    -   But definitions of "essential" are often tied to group identity rather than organizational purpose
-   [Psychological safety](g:psychological-safety) decreases
    -   Fear and uncertainty make people more risk-averse and less likely to speak up about concerns
-   Patterns of resistance change
    -   Pre-existing power structures are disrupted by crisis conditions
    -   So supporters may become opponents and vice versa
-   Crisis causes centralization
    -   "We don't have time for democracy"
-   Communication is more important than usual, but often skipped
-   Timelines shorten
    -   Pilot programs, gradual rollouts, and systematic reviews are often replaced by immediate, organization-wide implementation
-   "Temporary" becomes permanent
    -   Emergency measures implemented quickly often persist long after the crisis ends
    -   Documentation is skipped

## Fatigue and Burnout

-   Effects are cumulative
    -   Interactions between multiple concurrent changes create more stress than the sum of individual stresses
-   Watch for early warning signs
    -   Increased absenteeism, decreased performance, cynicism about new initiatives, complaints about "yet another bandwagon"
-   Take advantage of down time
    -   Train people in change management skills during quiet periods so they're better equipped to handle future changes
-   Provide stability anchors
    -   Maintain some consistent processes, traditions, or routines that people can rely on during periods of change
-   Communicate the roadmap
    -   Tell people how current changes fit into a larger plan
    -   And when change is expected to slow down
-   Establish a "change budget"
    -   Your job is their burden
-   Allow opt-outs where possible
    -   Let people to step back from leadership roles or volunteering if they're overwhelmed
-   Acknowledge survivor guilt
    -   Survivors of layoffs or restructurings often feel guilty as well as overwhelmed by new responsibilities
    -   *Talk about this*
