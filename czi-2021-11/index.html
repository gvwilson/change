class: subhead

## Introduction

- As project lead, you have to recalibrate your productivity sensors
- Producivity is no longer "how much code did I write?"
- It's "how many other people did something useful today?"

---

## The good news

- You don't have to invent this yourself
- <https://www.askamanager.org/>

*Progress, plans, and problems go up*

*Context, responsibilities, and priorities come down*

*"I am your guide and your umbrella."*

## Product manager vs. project manager

- The [product manager](g#product-manager) manages the feature list
  - What can't we do?
  - What hurts?
- The [project manager](g#project-manager) manages the schedule
  - Who is doing what?
  - When do we cut it and do something smaller?
- You are probably doing both…

---

## The build trap

- "Improving" doesn't always mean "adding features" <cite>Perri2018</cite>
- Most features are never used by most people

```
NAME
     ls -- list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1%] [file ...]
```

---

## Prioritization

- Sticky notes on a whiteboard
- Lots of discussion

{% include figure src="../leadership/prioritization-creating.png" alt="Prioritization on a 3x3 grid" %}

---

## Prioritization

- Guarantee some successes
- Be willing to ignore some things
- "A schedule's purpose is to tell us how far behind we are and what to do about it"

{% include figure src="../leadership/prioritization-using.png" alt="Prioritization on a 3x3 grid" %}

---

class: exercise

## Priorities

1. What are the three most important tasks for your project right now?
1. What are the three that are going to get the most time this week?

---

class: center middle

## break

---

class: subhead

## What problems are we trying to solve?

- "I didn't know your project existed"
  - (unspoken) "And now that I do, I don't know why I should care"
- "I gave up trying to make it work"
  - "Read the source" is the middle finger of open source

---

## Your actual product

- Your actual product is your grant proposals <cite>Kuchner2011</cite>
  - That's what people give you money for
- Your papers are "just" proof that you're worth funding
  - Because funders have a signal-to-noise problem too

---

## Getting the message to funders

- Be part of something larger
  - Borrow legitimacy
  - Note: if you're a senior figure, please lend legitimacy when you can
- [Collect data but tell stories](../change/)
- Contribute to discussion papers, requests for comment, etc.

---

## Branding

- A brand is the first thing people think of when they think of something
- A recognizable logo
- A short, simple tag line

> 1. Be first.
> 2. If you can't be first, create a new category to be first in.

---

## Crafting your message

1. For <em><u>description of target audience</u></em>
1. who want <em><u>statement of their needs</u></em>,
1. <em><u>project name</u></em>
1. provides <em><u>statement of key benefits</u></em>.
1. Unlike <em><u>alternative solution</u></em>,
1. we <em><u>key differentiator</u></em>.

---

## Crafting your message

1. For <em>post-docs, junior faculty, and industry equivalents</em>
1. who want <em>to manage research software projects</em>,
1. <em>this workshop</em>
1. provides <em>an introduction to key non-technical skills</em>.
1. Unlike <em>orientation sessions for new faculty and project management courses in industry</em>,
1. we <em>focus on topics particularly relevant to open science</em>.

---

class: exercise

## What's your value proposition?

1. For <em><u>description of target audience</u></em>
1. who want <em><u>statement of their needs</u></em>,
1. <em><u>project name</u></em>
1. provides <em><u>statement of key benefits</u></em>.
1. Unlike <em><u>alternative solution</u></em>,
1. we <em><u>key differentiator</u></em>.

---

class: exercise

## What's your brand?

1. What search terms would people use if they were looking for your software
   (not including your project's name)?
1. What turns up when you search for those terms?

class: center middle

## break

class: subhead

## What problems are we trying to solve?

- "We have budget—now who's going to do the work?"
- "We have to cut our losses…"

---

## Hiring

- Different from [recruiting new contributors](../newcomers/)
  - Though what you do once someone is hired may be very similar
- People do lots of simple things wrong <cite>Behroozi2020</cite>
- Ask Human Resources for mentoring
- *Always post positions*
  - One person's "I know a guy" is another's "I wasn't even invited"

---

## 1. Legal requirements

- Every jurisdiction has rules about hiring people
- Institutions often have union agreements or contractual obligations
- Talk to someone in Human Resources before doing anything else
  - Even if you've gone through this before, because rules can change

---

## 2. Contact

- Pay attention to details
  - Do they have or need work authorization?
  - Are they willing to relocate?
  - Do they actually have the right skills for this job?
  - [Starling Software](http://www.starling-software.com/employment/programmer-competency-matrix.html) is a good model
- Responsiveness
  - Acknowledge all communication
  - Give them timelines (and updates when timelines change)

---

## 3. Preparation

- Interview scheduling
  - Use [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) or a similar service
  - If you have to reschedule, give candidates several days' notice
  - If you have to reschedule twice, you're telling them you don't want them
- Hiring criteria
  - Describe the process and the kinds of questions they'll be asked
  - [Automattic](https://automattic.com/work-with-us/how-we-hire-developers/) is a good model

---

## 4. Interviews

- Make sure interviewers stick to the advertised process
  - Role-play a practice interview if you can
- Interviewers' knowledge
  - If you don't know enough to judge the candidate, find someone who can
- Make sure they're paying attention (rather than answering email)

---

## 5. Hearing back

- Status updates
  - Give candidates a timeline and regular updates
  - Don't try to hide the fact that you're interviewing other people
- Give feedback
  - "You're on the right track, but need to have done more with AWS and Kubernetes"
- People aren't always grateful for feedback
  - So it's best to do by email

---

## 6. Offer and negotiation

- Please consult Human Resources
- You *did* publish a salary band, right?

---

## Firing

- Sometimes people have good reasons for poor performance
- Sometimes they don't
- This is the hardest part of leading a project
- But keeping someone on the team who shouldn't be there is bad for morale as well as productivity

---

## 1. Legal requirements

- Every jurisdiction has rules about firing people, too
- Again, talk to someone in Human Resources before doing anything else

---

## 1. "Legal" requirements

- [Governance](../governance/) of every well-run open project spells out:
  - Criteria for being a project member
  - Who gets to decide when that privilege is revoked
- *You can't wait until you need these to write them*
- Review them before going any further

---

## 2. Check with someone

- Hard to work with someone you dislike
  - But not liking someone isn't sufficient reason to fire them
- Talk to someone outside the project
  - More likely to be objective
  - Less likely to let something slip
  - Less likely to feel pressured to take your side because you're the boss

---

## 3. Create a transition plan

- It's awkward to fire the only person who knows the password to the production server
  - And risky as well
- Suddenly asking someone to document their work is a give-away
- Better to ask everyone to do it all the time
  - Which helps keep roles and responsibilities up to date

---

## 3. Create a transition plan

- Write out the steps you'll take immediately after breaking the news
  - Change passwords on servers
  - Remove from GitHub group
  - Remove from mailing list
  - Return loaned hardware
- All of this needs to be done when someone leaves voluntarily
  - And helps you realize just how much "stuff" your project has

---

## 4. Make sure it's not a surprise

- If someone is surprised they're being fired, *you* have made a mistake
- If it's for poor behavior:
  - They should know what's in the [Code of Conduct](../conduct/)
  - And you should have given them warnings for minor violations
- If it's for poor performance:
  - You should have told them that they weren't meeting expectations…
  - …given them a chance to explain…
  - …and given them an opportunity to improve
- You will feel pretty bad if they've been missing deadlines because of a family illness

---

## 5. Delivery

- Write out what you're going to say
  - Keep it short
- Practice it a few times
- Then get straight to the point
- Don't get drawn into discussion of "what if"
- Stick to the practical matters you identified in the transition plan

---

## 6. Tell the team

- Make sure the team hears the news from you
  - Before rumors start to circulate
- Keep statement brief and to the point
- Do *not* discuss details
  - The person you fired has a right to privacy
  - And you don't want other team members worrying that you'll say something about them some day

---

## 7. Keep a record of all communication

- It's hard for people to think clearly when you're angry or hurt
  - And they may not act in good faith
- Communicate by email
- If they insist on a call:
  - Ask to record it and give them permission to do the same
  - Or have a third party present

---

## 8. Remember that it's OK to cry

- Because we all do

---

class: exercise

## Lottery factor

1. What do you know how to do on the project that no one else knows?
1. What *don't* you know how to do that someone else does?

---

class: exercise

## Permission

1. Whose permission do you need to hire or fire someone?
1. Or (for open source projects) to give someone commit permission or take it away?

---

class: exercise

## Fire yourself

1. Write three or four sentences to tell yourself you've been fired.
1. Trade with someone else and give each other the bad news.

## What problems are we trying to solve?

- "Oh no: not another meeting…"
- "Did we decide that?"
- "It's not what you know, it's who you know."

---

## Governance models

- <https://communityrule.info/> describes [lots of options](./gov-booklet-MASTER.pdf)
- [Benevolent dictator](g#benevolent-dictator) (often the project founder)
  - Common in young projects
  - Brittle (founder can move on)
  - Usually leads to emergence of unofficial (i.e., unaccountable) leaders
- Elected representation
  - Explicit rules for suffrage
- Consensus-based
  - If most people agree on most things most of the time

---

class: sidebar

## The chief surgeon model

- Brooks advocated a [chief programmer](g#chief-programmer) model in the 1970s <cite>Brooks1995</cite>
- Disparaged since then
  - But 80% of projects on GitHub are [hero projects](g#hero-project) <cite>Majumder2019</cite>
  - 5% or less of people responsible for 95% or more of interactions
  - "Heroes" commit far fewer bugs than other contributors
- Despite terminology, not a bad model for research projects
  - <cite>Petre2014</cite> found that people without domain knowledge couldn't review scientific code effectively

---

class: sidebar

## Ducking the issue

- From GitHub's [Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG) guidelines

> **2.1. Consensus-Based Decision Making**. Projects make decisions through consensus of the Maintainers. While explicit agreement of all Maintainers is preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Maintainers will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the Contributors and nature of support and objections. The Maintainers will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements.

---

## [Martha's Rules](g#marthas-rules)

- Anyone can put forward a proposal by filing it at least 24 hours before a scheduled meeting
  - One-line summary
  - Background information
  - Concrete proposal
  - Pros and cons
  - Alternatives
- At most two pages
  - Preferably shorter

---

## Establishing a quorum

- A quorum is established if half or more of voting members are present
- Which means there must be:
  - A rule about how to become a member
  - A rule about when and how someone stops being a member
- The meeting may not discuss or vote on a proposal unless its sponsor (or their delegate) is present.

---

## Presenting a proposal

- The sponsor has 5 minutes to present the proposal
- Members cast a [sense vote](g#sense-vote): support, neutral, or oppose
  - If everyone supports or is neutral, go immediately to a binary vote with no further discussion
  - If a majority is opposed or neutral, send proposal back to sponsor for further work
- If a minority of members oppose, set a timer for 10 minutes of moderated discussion
- Then call a final binary vote in which everyone must support or oppose (no neutral votes allowed)
- If a majority support, the proposal is accepted
  - Otherwise, it is returned to the sponsor for further work

---

</div>

- Gives you a list of what actually needs to be done
  - It's always longer than you first expect
- Tells everyone who to go to for what
  - Particularly when their first choice is on holiday
- Helps with succession planning
  - "We don't have anyone who does that any more…"

---

## Code of Conduct

- Diverse communities need explicit norms
  - "I didn't realize someone would find that offensive"
  - Which is sometimes used dishonestly…
- Adopt a [Code of Conduct](../conduct/) (e.g., [Python](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/)'s)
- Be explicit about enforcement mechanisms and consequences
  - *Do the background reading* <cite>Aurora2019</cite>

---

## Meetings

- On par with interruptions for "things people wish they could have less of"
- Unlike interruptions, can be done well
- As with governance, having rules is the first and biggest step toward efficiency

---

## 1. Does there actually need to be a meeting?

- To *inform*? Only if you are expecting questions
- To *consult*? Only if people get a vote
  - Otherwise it's just informing with pretense
- To *discuss* and *make decisions*? Yes
  - But only in small groups
  - Or with well-defined procedural rules
- To *brainstorm* or *collaborate*?
  - That's a very different kind of meeting

---

## 2. Create an agenda

- If you don't care enough to make a list, you don't need a meeting
- Include timings
- Prioritize
- Plan to end early
  - "The most fundamental unit of time is the bladder"

---

## 3. Have clear rules for making decisions

- "The Tyranny of Structurelessness" <cite>Freeman1972</cite>
- If you need [Robert's Rules](g#roberts-rules), you need training

---

## 4. Put someone in charge

- The moderator should *not* do most of the talking
  - Any more than the conductor plays most of the notes
- Call on specific people in order
- Allow them one point at a time
- Keep a backlog

---

## 5. Require politeness

- All the other rules are special cases of this…
- No technology during in-person meeting
  - Except for assistive technology or family need
  - "Please put your devices in politeness mode"
- No interruptions
  - Except by moderator
- No rambling
- You *do* have a Code of Conduct, right?

---

## 6. Record minutes

- So people who weren't there know what happened
- So people who were there agree what happened
- So people can be held accountable at later meetings

---

## 7. Manage "that guy"

      <li><a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/ddb/">https://coast.noaa.gov/ddb/</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

---

## 8. Be an active participant

- Decline invitations
  - *If* you agree to abide by what the meeting decides
- Read the agenda and material before the meeting
- Take your own notes
- Use participants' names
- Pause before speaking
- Put down your hand

---

## 9. Life online

- No mixed-mode meetings
  - All in person or all online
- Do not record the meeting without willing consent
- Review meeting protocol at the start if necessary
- Take minutes in a shared document
- Raise hands digitally
  - `/hand` in the chat is good
  - `/hand another budget item` is better

---

## 10. Seek truth, not victory

- No social dominance displays
  - "Well actually…"
- Don't raise points you don't actually believe in
  - The devil doesn't need more advocates
- Don't make excuses for your questions or opinions
  - "This is probably stupid, but…"

## Conclusion

- Managing is a "knowing how" skill
  - Improves with mentoring and reflective practice
- *Talk to your peers*
  - If only to sympathize with each other
- I hope <https://codebender.org> will grow up to be
  a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org)-style workshop on the subject
- If you'd like to help, issues and pull requests are very welcome
